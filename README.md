"history":"Before entering Lokheim, she was a demigod, with no powers. It is well known that demigods are a relatively perfect race, but not Veera, as she is a minority born with imperfections. Veera struggles every day to survive with her wits and teach others what she knows, earning her the title of "The Sage of the Land." One of her visitors is Maloch. He is unusually strong and quick-tempered, but deep down he is an innocent child who, under Veera's guidance, is able to learn to control his powers.But one day, as the civilization grew, the Temple of Light branded the demigods like Veera as heretics. Eventually, the demigods were sent to the Orphean Mountains under the care of Edras, the sorcerer of Veda. Veera's journey was not so pretty due to her weak body. She tried to ask the soldiers of the Temple of Light for help to slow her down, but they ignored her and even bullied her during the journey. However, Veera was saved by the help of Maloch and the others in the expedition, which caused hatred towards the Temple of Light to begin to arise in Veera's heart.After staying there for a short while, Veera's actions greatly pleased Edras, who promised Veera that he would cure the abnormalities in her body and transform her into a perfect demigod. However, this did not lessen her hatred for the Temple of Light, and when she learned that the gods had intended for her to be the ruler of this world, Veera began to think of creating her own destiny.Soon after, a resistance group was formed by Volkath, who declared himself an enemy of the Temple of Light, and Veera joined without hesitation. With her abilities, the resistance group defeated the soldiers of the Temple of Light and successfully escaped. They then formed a new group called the Abyss. Her intelligence allowed her to become an advisor and strategist for Volkath and Maloch, and also became the strongest and most powerful army. It is said that she is called the Queen of the Night because she received power from Manyara, the creator of the night. Veera received a strong and fascinating body, unlike her original body that was weak and diseased. In the Abyss Army, Maloch was the greatest commander and the ruler of the Abyss in name only. In reality, the one who was pulling the strings behind the scenes was Veera, just like what Ilumia did in the Temple of Light."
